# AI Technology Guide

## Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized how we approach complex problems and automate tasks.

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through rewards and penalties

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

### Key NLP Tasks:
- Text classification
- Named entity recognition
- Sentiment analysis
- Question answering
- Text generation

## Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs like GPT are transformer-based models trained on vast amounts of text data.

### Popular LLMs:
- GPT-3.5/GPT-4 by OpenAI
- Claude by Anthropic
- LLaMA by Meta
- Gemini by Google

## Vector Databases
Vector databases store and search high-dimensional vectors efficiently.

### Examples:
- ChromaDB
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Qdrant

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines retrieval systems with generative models to provide more accurate and contextual responses.

### RAG Process:
1. Document ingestion and vectorization
2. Query processing and vector search
3. Context retrieval
4. Response generation with retrieved context

## Applications
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Document analysis
- Content generation
- Code assistance
- Knowledge management systems
