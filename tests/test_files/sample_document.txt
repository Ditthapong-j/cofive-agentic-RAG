Sample Document for Testing

This is a sample text document used for testing the Agentic RAG API system.

Introduction:
The Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is designed to provide intelligent responses based on uploaded documents. This system combines the power of vector search with large language models to create a conversational AI agent.

Key Features:
1. Document Upload: Support for PDF, TXT, and MD files
2. Vector Storage: Efficient document storage using ChromaDB
3. Intelligent Search: Semantic search capabilities
4. AI Agent: LangChain-powered conversational agent
5. REST API: FastAPI-based web service

Architecture:
- Document Loader: Handles various file formats
- Vector Store Manager: Manages ChromaDB operations
- Agentic RAG: Core AI agent functionality
- API Server: RESTful web service endpoints

Technical Stack:
- FastAPI for web framework
- LangChain for AI agent
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- OpenAI for language models
- Streamlit for user interface

Testing Information:
This document contains information about machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. It can be used to test queries about:
- How does the RAG system work?
- What are the key features?
- What technologies are used?
- How is the system architected?

Sample Questions to Test:
1. What is the Agentic RAG system?
2. What file formats are supported?
3. Which database is used for vector storage?
4. What AI technologies are involved?
5. How does the architecture work?

Performance Metrics:
- Response time: Under 2 seconds for typical queries
