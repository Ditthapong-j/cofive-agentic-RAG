        Welcome to the Agentic RAG System!
        
        This is a sample document to demonstrate the capabilities of the system.
        
        The Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combines:
        1. Document retrieval from a vector database
        2. Agent-based reasoning with tools
        3. Large language model generation
        
        Key features:
        - Multi-source document loading (PDF, text, web pages)
        - Intelligent document search and retrieval
        - Agent with multiple tools (search, calculate, summarize)
        - Conversation memory
        - Source citation
        
        You can ask questions about the documents, perform calculations, 
        get summaries, and the agent will use the appropriate tools to help you.
